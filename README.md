# NHI-TAI-codes for thermal anomalies detection
The code, written in Google Earth Engine, computes the NHI and TAI values for each pixel of the satellite image (MSI/S2). The region of interest must be specified as input. The shapefiles of the steel plant targets in Avilés and Gijón are archived and publicly available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18454763
).
The two algorithms estimate:
i) the frequency with which the signal exceeds a predefined threshold over the 2016–2024 time period;
ii) the maximum value of this exceedance within the input vector on an annual or multi-annual basis;
iii) the temporal trend of the two indices, which can be plotted within the same time window.
